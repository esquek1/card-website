                I’m a queer Filipino native
                <br /> to Los Angeles, and
                <br />
                illustrations are my jam.
                <br /> I’m always looking for
                <br />
                ways to infuse that
                <br />
                creative spark into my
                <br />
                work. When I’m not
                <br />
                designing, you’ll find me
                <br />
                hanging out with animals
                <br />
                (specifically my cats),
                <br />
                cooking up new recipes,
                <br />
                listening to new music,
                <br />
                sampling delicious foods,
                <br />
                getting competitive in
                <br />
                first-person shooter
                <br />
                games, or losing myself
                <br />
                in a good puzzle. Life’s too
                <br />
                short for boring hobbies!
